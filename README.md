# Artificial Composer

Extremely old Java GUI program I made when I was learning Java at school.

Uses Fourier transforms to guess the notes it records in a very inefficient way, but it worked. It can then save the recording as XML files which would be the most simple and verbose form of MIDI you could imagine.

Since it was part of an AI course there's some shady "AI" stuff in there that I'm pretty sure doesn't do much. I got a good grade anyway.

I have to try to have it run on modern JVMs and avoid cringing at my old code.

# TODO
- [ ] The "shared" dependency has to be resolved, there's a copy of it in the "binary" folder.
